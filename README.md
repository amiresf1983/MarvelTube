## Description

As a Marvel fan, I want to search for Marvel content while utilising Youtube simultaneously, so that I can see videos and some information about the character I have searched in a single page.

This is a web application that Integrates Youtube API and Marvel API to produce a simpler search experience. In this project, a user can either search for a Marvel character or click any of the pre-loaded images and the application would show several Youtube videos related to that selected character.

Users can use the Register button on the top-left of the page, enter their email addresses and passwords, and the program would use localStorage to remember those details.

This project is built using HTML, [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/), a CSS framework, and several server-side API's namely [Youtube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube) and [Marvel API](https://developer.marvel.com/).

## Website

The following animations show the web application's appearance and functionality:
